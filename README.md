# About this Project

This project is being created as an application for the Chingu.io program. The first part of their application process is a submission of a project to evaluare your skills before starting a "voyage" with them. This project will be based off the requirements they issue on the [page](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier3-journal-app). That being said, the code written for this project will be of my own.
