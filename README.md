# About this Project

This project is being created as an application for the Chingu.io program. The first part of their application process is a submission of a project to evaluare your skills before starting a "voyage" with them. This project will be based off the requirements they issue on the [page](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier3-journal-app). That being said, the code written for this project will be of my own.

# Goals

The goal of this project is to create a journaling app that is connected to a SQLite database. I will be using Node and Express and for server calls and either fetch or axios. For the frontend, I am debating between HTML/CSS/JS or using React. 

Updates will come on a daily basis as this project is due September 28th.
