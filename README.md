# Rafael's Journal App

This is my first full stack app post Codecademy bootcamp. I was able to implement so much of what I learned. From creating my own database to working with React. The last 10 days (09-18-20 to 09-28-20) have been hectic but they were fun. I can truly say that this was a result of all of my knowledge and effort.


# About the Project

This project is being created as an application for the Chingu.io program. The first part of their application process is a submission of a project to evaluare your skills before starting a "voyage" with them. This project will be based off the requirements they issue on the [page](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier3-journal-app).

# Goals

The goal of this project is to create a journaling app that is connected to a SQLite database. I will be using Node and Express and for server calls and either fetch or axios. For the frontend, I will be using React.
